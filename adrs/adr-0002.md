# Don't refactor terraform-docs generated documentation

If you see markdown documentation between `<!-- BEGIN_TF_DOCS -->` and `<!-- END_TF_DOCS -->`, it means that it was generated with [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs). Don't refactor it as such documentation is autogenerated and should be overriden by `terraform-docs` execution in CI environment. Refactoring autogenerated docs only generates extra review effort for person accepting your changes.
