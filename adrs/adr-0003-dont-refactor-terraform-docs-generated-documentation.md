# Don't refactor terraform-docs generated documentation

## Context

Our modules embed generated documentation snippets between `<!-- BEGIN_TF_DOCS -->` and `<!-- END_TF_DOCS -->` comments. These sections come from [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs) during local workflows or CI pipelines. Contributors sometimes notice formatting issues or outdated content inside these blocks and attempt to "clean them up" manually.

## Decision

Treat all content between the terraform-docs markers as generated output and leave it untouched. When documentation needs to change, update the underlying Terraform configuration and let CI pipeline update the documentation. Manually refactoring autogenerated docs only generates extra review effort for person accepting your changes.

## Consequences

**Positive**

- Keeps generated documentation in sync with module inputs/outputs without drift.
- Avoids noisy diffs and review churn caused by manual tweaks that will be overwritten.
- Reinforces a consistent workflow: update code, then regenerate docs.

**Negative**

- Contributors should know how that terraform-docs is CI generated.

## Alternatives considered

- **Manual edits of generated markdown:** rejected because CI regeneration would overwrite the changes and waste reviewer effort.
- **Local generation before commit:** possible, but discouraged. Relying on contributors to run terraform-docs locally can lead to inconsistencies and missed steps. We prefer CI automation to ensure documentation is always up-to-date and standardized.
